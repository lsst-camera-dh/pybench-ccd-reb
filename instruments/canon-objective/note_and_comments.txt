Some comments on the canon objective :

- If we want to initiate properly the objective and make it move, be careful how we fix it on its "ring". There is a little angular space when it seems to be fixed so it can continue to move. To avoid this problem, you have to turn the objective the more anticlockwise you can.

- If a manual command is launch before using one in focus move, the manual command does not work. Clue : vpowPin ?
