Some comments on the canon objective :

2015-04-22

- If we want to initiate properly the objective and make it move, be careful how we fix it on its "ring". There is a little angular space when it seems to be fixed so it can continue to move. To avoid this problem, you have to turn the objective the more anticlockwise you can.

- If a manual command is launch before using one in focus move, the manual command does not work. Clue : vpowPin ?

- 44 is the hexadecimal code for D, hence a problem with the command if it is note reinitialized each time.

2015-04-23

- Understood why a manual command work even if we do not put the vpowPin (power motor) to LOW : because in focus move, there is one digitalWrite(vpowPin, LOW); to power up the motor, but at the end to shut down the motor, it is also written digitalWrite(vpowPin, LOW); instead of digitalWrite(vpowPin, HIGH);.

- To avoid the problem, need to power up and down the motor befor and after sending the command.

- If the motor is always power up, possibility to obtain again the same position ater a shut down ? Because a priori it is no possible.

- About mouvement : 4400 is to go toward the ring. From 00 to FF for the number of step. 44FF is to go the oposit way. From FF to 00 for the number of step. Need further investigation, for exemple 4401FF is the double of 4400FF ? Yes it seems to be the double. So 44FE00 should be the double in the oposit way ? Ok seems to be this way. Warning : if it is really the one's complement, FFFF should make a zero step ? Is there a shift ? Look at the focus_move() function.

- Negative value correspond to a movement toward focus max (0x06)
- Positive value correspond to a movement toward focus min (0x05)

Number = binary = one's complement
0 = 00000000 = 11111111 = FF = 0
1 = 00000001 = 11111110 = FE = -1
2 = 00000010 = 11111101 = FD = -2
...

True movement :
1 = 0001
-1 = FFFF

The information is on two bytes ie : FF and FF 

- When the objective is unpluged and then repluged, the position is set to 0.

-Just by eye : we can't really make the difference between 1 step and 10 step. 44000A seems to be smaller than 440001. No, in fact it seems to be an hysteresis. When the objective go one way, and then the other way, if your first movement the other way is just one step, it seems bigger than ten because the "ring" have to move more. But then if you make another one step, it is smaller.

- Hysteresis seems to be confirmed in the movement of the ring but not confirmed on the real movement of the objective.

- Number of step on the whole range ? :
   - Going down : 4x16x16 
   - Going up : 4x16x16 

- For the two ways : in fact it seems to be less (1024 is a max limit). Make more tests.

- Down : 3x16x16 + 8x16 + 4x16
- Up : 3x16x16 + 8x16 + 4x16

- The movement seems to be reversible, ie there is the sme number of steps way down and way up (near 960)

- Test with 900 : 
- Down : 900 + 10 + 10 + (10 stop) seems to be 925 +- 5
- Up : 920 +- 5

- Test doing 920 up then down many times to see if there is always the same number of steps for a whole range. Ok, seems to always have a number of steps above 900 in each direction.

- Today's goal : understand how the objective give its position.

- First test : go focus min and max and ask the position :
  - Max : (FFFFFFFF,FFFFFFF7) (FFFFFFFF,FFFFFFEA) (FFFFFFFF,FFFFFFE7)
    	  (FFFFFFFF,FFFFFFFD) (0,B) (0,1F) (0,2D) (0,31) (0,37) (0,3E)
  - Min : (3,FFFFFFDD) (3,FFFFFFD4) (3,FFFFFFD5)
    	  (3,FFFFFFE0) (3,FFFFFFFB) (4,2) (4,4) (4,A) (4,11) (4,18)

- Unplug and replug :
  - Asking position before any movement (theoreticaly at min) :
    	   - (0,0)
	   - if going at min (same position) change the value ? :
	     	- (0,2E) then max at (FFFFFFFC,51)

- Going at middle (approx 450 steps toward min), then unplug and replug :
  - Position : (0,0) and wait 10 minutes (0,0)

- Then Min and max :
  - Max : (FFFFFFFD,FFFFFFE0) (FFFFFFFD,FFFFFFE8) (FFFFFFFD,FFFFFFF2)
    	  (FFFFFFFD,FFFFFFF9)
  - Min : (1,FFFFFFC2) (1,FFFFFFC5) (1,FFFFFFCC) (1,FFFFFFD5)

- On the https://pickandplace.wordpress.com/2011/10/05/canon-ef-s-protocol-and-electronic-follow-focus/ :
  - He seems to have the same problem : have to go on the whole range to count the number of steps and then keep the number in the firmware.
  - It is a USM motor (Utra-sonic motor) : seems to work with pi√©zo.

- Added Poll the lens in the loop function, before the executeCommand.

- Next test to do : go middle, unplug then replug : ask position (should be at 0) move one step or ten or more, then ask position again... should be 1, 10... ?

- Observation :
  - I don't understand the behaviour under 10 step. The moving command seems to have a unprecision of +3 steps each times you mmove the focus. Above ten the relative error begins to be small. Under ten it is huge.
  - A priori you can determine the direction of displacement of the last moving. If the response to C00000 is FFxx then the objective was going toward the max. If it is OOxx, it was going toward the min. Or it is just relative with respect to the initial 0 (See how precisely a USM motor work !)

- Next test : beginning at middle, unplug and replug and then test the behavior at the min and max focus (ie what become the position if i am at the max or min and I want to go further ?)

- Next test : if we want to reinitialize the position (put the current at 0) can we just make init_Lens() ? With the actual init_lens(), the position is the same. Find a way to :
       - power on a first time
       - go at an extrema
       - go to the middle
       - reinitialize (put vddPin HIGH then LOW manually ?)
       - We are at the middle at position 0 !

- To do : test the behavior for small movements (under ten steps)

- To do : do 100 steps and then 10x10 step back

- Next test : the last bit is shifted ? (not taken into account) : to do 1 steps needs to make 440003 ? I don't understand why there is a movement if I make 440001 ? Then, if it is not really taken into account, why the movement is higher by 2 and not less by two steps ?

- Make a focus.txt and read doc on line how they mke their auto-focus (variance, first term of fourier transform...)

- Test to take some images :

2015-05-11

- For the autofocus : try points on the whole range, then try to find a variation for the variance. Then go to th max, and do the same with a smaller step.

- Take some photo with the python implementation

- Can we have the photos in fits ?

- scp -r directory/ rlebret@lpnp204:/data/bench/test_pattern/

- New objective : works ok !

- Need to do some new test about the range.

- For the autofocus : it seems to be a delay when in a loop i launch a command and then take a picture.

- Go to an extremum, then reinitialize the position, go to the other extremum, and ask the position : should give the number of step : I don't understand the result ? When an extremum is touched, the counter seems to continue to move.

- From max to min : 0000 to 03E2 = 994 steps ?
- From min to max : 0000 to FC1F = 992 steps ?

- Beware of the axis : when you go to min, the number of steps is positive, when you go to max the number of steps is negative, as for the position.

- If I move "by hand" : 
  From max to min : 900 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 then can't go further => Something like 940
  From min to max : 900 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 then can't go further => Something like 940

- Update auto-focus : asking position complete.

- Do a double table for images and position [[image1,pos1],[image2,pos2]] ! No, better to make different lists

- Functions to save images and init the focalization (take picture over the whole range by a define number of step).

- Warning : check the returned position values (if there is no problem ? 0 missing, if it is of for hexadecimal character).

- First series without test target : without the objective, juste camera and LED
- Second series without test target : pose of 33.3 ms instead of 66.6 ms
- Third series without test target : LED objective and camera at 33.3 ms
- The next series are done near the objectif (smaller light cone)
- The last is done for with a ligth cone that presumably cover the whole CCD. (100ms) (interfringes 30 pix, very bad contrast)

- When the light one is the smaller, the contrast is better, and the interfringes is about 10 pix = this can be for precise study, because it is not on the whole CCD

- To do : in the blackbox and with the test target further

- Do not move the light source !!!!
- Do with objective + camera + led and objective+camera+led+target !
- With no saturation the better focus !

2015-05-15

- First serie : with target 5ms
- same as before
- 10 ms
- 10 ms but saturation
- 8 ms target has been moved : min 20 max 210 interfringes 7 pix

- Kind of circular pattern of blur : seems to be the parallelism of the different element

2015-05-18

- Series of focus with 5ms, the LED further away and brigth, area of illumination about 2*2cm
- 25ms
- 50ms
- five flat at 50ms

2015-05-19

- Series with vertical stripes.
- Autofocus do not work if there (see 20150519/*fits)
- Do not forget that the amateur camera is special : there is a vertical serie register for all the vertical array of pixels : hence the algorithm to find the wavelength of the fringes finds somethings shorter than in reality.
- The algorithme does not really find the good wavelength. It is a mean avec the whole image.
- Take series with a diffuser far from the target and then near (less than a cm, on the same support).

- Put all the setup on the optical table with regularly spaced holes
- Protect space between camera and objective.
- Series with vertical stripes and diffuser (100ms).
- Series with more flux, diffuser closer from LED (100ms).

- End the auto-focus !

2015-05-22

- Auto focus with 100ms with around 4cm sqaure illuminated
- Auto focus with 100ms with around 4cm sqaure illuminated : interfringes 28 pix of the mateur camera. The flux is not good because more surface is illuminated. I can't increase the pose time above 100 ms ? but I think this is not a problem, if we have more flux, the contrast should be good.
- Series of flat. 
- Range to move the target between focus min an max with focused image : 1 or 2 cm, no more than 3 (for the same setup as before)



- For next time : try to move the source ! Why is a decrease of flux on the left edge ?
- Finish the autofocus

2015-05-26

- Delay, power, commands library, fonction global "send"
- go toward max, then go back with a smaller step, stop, fit parabole, determination step

2015-05-27

- To avoid Delay, use busy Poll ? Seems to return always the same value "0xAA" !
- Movement is constrained by the camera time to take a picture.
- I have begun to optimize the time : motor are powered up only for movement and there is a delay only if there is a movement.
- Need to refined the auto-focus. The turn back condition is not really the good one.

- Take a finished auto-focus, and put the variance curve and the result in the note.

2015-05-28

- Auto focus almost finished.
- Need to put the theo_mov and position in the HDU list ?
- After many auto_focus, it seems to be reproductible : the max is still around the same position (here it is about 600)
- Strange shape in the variance plot : the is a small gap at the middle of the curve ?
